The file contains daily Weather Observations list observations of a number of weather elements each day for years 2008 to 2017.

Project Goals:
- to achieve an unsupervised study, by using a clustering algorithm, of the entire dataset in order to individuate the common features of the weather observations
- partition of the dataset both in political regions and by geographical coordinates
- prediction of RainTomorrow target variable, both in the original dataset and in the obtained clusters, with the achievement of several classification models
- prediction of Risk_MM variable, which indicates the rainfall level the day after in millimeters, by using some regression models
